# Kanboard
Web application providing shared Kanban boards for better team productivity.

Work In Progress: This is a personal project developed with the goal of practicing full-stack development.

* API built with [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node), [Express.js](https://github.com/expressjs/express)
* PostgreSQL database

Frontend:
* Single page app using [React.js](https://github.com/facebook/react), built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router), and [React Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux)

### Note
This project is derivative of [Huddle](https://github.com/ReflexCS180/ReflexManagment) by Team Reflex at UC Riverside (which I was a part of). I am remaking the project from scratch for practice with full-stack development. The differences are that Huddle used React.js with Firebase Realtime Database, while Kanboard uses React.js + Redux, plus a backend API in Express.js communicating with a PostgreSQL database.

However, although the idea was born in that (awesome) team, not a single line of code was copied from that project.
